## ü§ù Code of Conduct

This project follows a code of conduct to ensure a welcoming environment for all contributors. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and **npm**
- **VS Code** or **Cursor IDE** 1.73.0+
- **Git** for version control
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript and VS Code extensions

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dom-agent.git
   cd dom-agent
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Development Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Start development build with watch mode
   npm run watch
   ```

4. **Launch Extension Development Host:**
   - Open the project in Cursor IDE
   - Press `F5` to launch Extension Development Host
   - Test your changes in the new window

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Choose an Issue

- Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/your-username/dom-agent/issues) for open tasks
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Comment on the issue to indicate you're working on it

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Follow the [Coding Standards](#coding-standards)
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation if needed
- Ensure all tests pass

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Use conventional commit format:

```bash
# For features
git commit -m "feat: add new DOM element highlighting feature"

# For bug fixes
git commit -m "fix: resolve XPath generation issue in Firefox"

# For documentation
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"

# For refactoring
git commit -m "refactor: simplify HTML processing logic"
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push your branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create a Pull Request on GitHub
```

## üíª Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- **Strict Type Checking**: All code must pass TypeScript's strict mode
- **Interface Definitions**: Use interfaces for complex object types
- **Type Guards**: Implement proper type guards for runtime type checking
- **Generic Types**: Use generics appropriately to ensure type safety

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Proper typing
interface ElementInfo {
  tag: string;
  classes: string[];
  attributes: Record<string, string>;
  boundingBox: {
    x: number;
    y: number;
    width: number;
    height: number;
  };
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Using any
function processElement(element: any) {
  // ...
}
```

### Code Style

- **ESLint Compliance**: All code must pass ESLint checks
- **Consistent Naming**: Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes
- **Descriptive Names**: Choose meaningful, descriptive variable and function names
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function/class should have a single, clear purpose

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Descriptive and focused
export class ElementSelector {
  private generateCSSSelector(element: HTMLElement): string {
    // Single responsibility: generate CSS selector
  }

  private generateXPath(element: HTMLElement): string {
    // Single responsibility: generate XPath
  }
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Multiple responsibilities in one function
function processElement(element: HTMLElement): void {
  // Generate selector, update UI, save to database...
}
```

### Error Handling

- **Try-Catch Blocks**: Use appropriate error handling
- **Custom Errors**: Create custom error classes for specific scenarios
- **Logging**: Use the centralized logger for all logging needs
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Provide clear error messages for users

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Proper error handling
try {
  const result = await this.captureWebpage(url);
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  this.logger.error('Failed to capture webpage', { url, error });
  throw new CaptureError(`Unable to capture webpage: ${url}`);
}
```

### Performance Considerations

- **Efficient DOM Queries**: Use efficient selectors and minimize DOM traversals
- **Memory Management**: Clean up event listeners and resources properly
- **Async Operations**: Use async/await consistently for asynchronous operations
- **Bundle Size**: Be mindful of dependencies and their impact on bundle size

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Minimum Coverage**: Maintain 80%+ code coverage

### Testing Best Practices

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Comprehensive test with edge cases
describe('ElementSelector', () => {
  describe('generateCSSSelector', () => {
    it('should generate ID selector for element with unique ID', () => {
      const element = createMockElement('<div id="unique-id"></div>');
      const selector = selector.generateCSSSelector(element);
      expect(selector).toBe('#unique-id');
    });

    it('should generate class selector when ID is not unique', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });

    it('should handle elements with special characters in attributes', () => {
      // Test edge cases
    });
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- src/utils/validation.test.ts

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## üìö Documentation

### Documentation Standards

- **README Updates**: Keep README.md current with new features
- **Code Comments**: Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- **Inline Comments**: Explain complex logic with clear comments
- **API Documentation**: Document all public interfaces and types

### Documentation Structure

```
